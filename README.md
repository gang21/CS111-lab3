# Hash Hash Hash
This lab creates a hash table implementation that is safe to use concurrently. 

## Building
```shell

```

## Running
```shell

```

## First Implementation
In the `hash_table_v1_add_entry` function, xxx

### Performance
```shell
Generation: 72,600 usec
Hash table base: 362,071 usec
  - 0 missing
Hash table v1: 703,576 usec
  - 0 missing

```

This time version 1 is xxx

## Second Implementation
In the `hash_table_v2_add_entry` function, xxx

### Performance
```shell

```

This time the speed up is xxx

## Cleaning up
```shell

```
